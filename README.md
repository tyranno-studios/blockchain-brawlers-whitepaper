# Our Beliefs

We believe that players wants total control over the assets they have acquired. They want to have the right to trade, sell, or giveaway anything they have garnered from within a game be it purchased, crafted, traded for or otherwise obtained.

We believe that players deserve individual sovereignty with regard to the decision on what they can do with digital items in their possession. 

We believe these rights are a fundamental and they are inalienable for game players in the world, independent of platform, genre, asset class, or socio-economic status. 

We believe that this level of control and authority will drive the mass adoption of a complimentary Web3 experience that does not only co-exists with standard gaming tenants, but will become table stakes for all players in the future.

We believe in building the best games for all gamers. We lead with objectively excellent entertainment. We aim to always validate a players use of their free time within the worlds we have built. 

We believe in leading by example. We are building a North Star that will lead the way to the benefit of every developer, publisher and gamer in the world. 

We believe all of the ideals fully live and breathe inside Blockchain Brawlers. A truly great game, that just happens to be built on the blockchain 
    

# Design Principles

Blockchain Brawlers is a platform. It is a multiphase, multifaceted world where players come in and compete, contribute, commune and collaborate. 

Our experiences always are built with the gamer in mind. We start with the player concerns and works backwards to a feature or product enhancement that resolves that point of tension or friction. By being so user journey focused, a clear and optimized path exists on how to move forward to the benefit of the greater good in the most expeditious way possible. 

There are many challenges in working towards mass market adoption, but in Blockchain Brawlers we do not believe access and usability should be some of those hurdles. 

Blockchain Brawler players will be able to play and transact on the chain and marketplace of choice. Making our game the most user friendly and navigable game in the world is a stated goal we think we are on the path to accomplish. 

To reach our player adoption goals, Blockchain Brawlers has to be very familiar to players of traditional games. This is why when you immerse yourself into our "Brawlerverse" it will feel like every non-crypto game you have played before.

Currently available to be played in a browser we will soon add a download Mac and PC client via the Epic Store, along with mobile apps to be found in the App Store as well as on Google Play coming in late 2022. 

# Player vs. Player Asset Requirements

While the list of needs is not exhaustive to compete in head to head play, we thought they were vital enough that it warranted it's own headline and detailed overview. 

In the PvP mode coming out Fall '22 you will play a card battler as mentioned above. This means you will need to have a Brawler NFT, some playing cards, and the requisite set of moves of your own choosing. 

Below is an accounting of the minimum items you will need to wage war in the squared circle. 

Must Haves:
(1) NFT Brawler (including but not limited to) - [Mike Yellerbelly](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&data:text.rarity=Artifact&order=asc&schema_name=series1&sort=price&symbol=WAX), [Scotty Wideye](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&data:text.rarity=Common&order=asc&schema_name=series1&sort=price&symbol=WAX), [Barry Greenhorn](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&data:text.rarity=Uncommon&order=asc&schema_name=series1&sort=price&symbol=WAX), [Johnny Butterfinger](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&data:text.rarity=Rare&order=asc&schema_name=series1&sort=price&symbol=WAX), [Colt Tenderfoot](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&data:text.rarity=Epic&order=asc&schema_name=series1&sort=price&symbol=WAX), [Rusty Klutz](https://wax.atomichub.io/market/sale/89934148), [Ric Flair](https://wax.atomichub.io/market/sale/90085842), or any of our [legendary NFT's](https://wax.atomichub.io/market/sale/85365924) that are 1 of 1's. 

## How to Take Part in the PvP Phase

In order to participate in the PvP modes in Blockchain Brawlers just visit the site play.bcbrawlers.com and from there the onboarding into the user experience is self-explanatory.  

# The Phases of The Game
## The Mining Phase
The Mining Phase opened on March 30th, 2022 and concluded on August 1st, 2022. This was were players where able to mine the 1 billion fungible [$BRWL tokens](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/brwl-brawlertoken_wax-eosio.token) if they possessed a [Series 1 Brawler NFT](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&order=asc&schema_name=series1&sort=price&symbol=WAX) and a Ring. 

Once the token inventory was exhausted the ability to mine the currency via this farming interactivity was ended. It will not resume ever again. 

## The Crafting Phase: BRAWL-O-SEUM
The Crafting Phase began on September 21st, 2022. If a player is in possession of a [Brawl-o-Seum](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&order=asc&schema_name=land&sort=price&symbol=WAX) NFT they are able to utilize $BRWL tokens to craft every asset required to play every version of PvP that does or will exist in perpetuity. 

The Brawl-o-Seum is effectively a crafting membership key. These limited number of players will be in charge of producing content for the masses that want to enter the game. There are only 1,100 "B-o-S" NFT crafting passes in existence. They come in two levels of rarity. The Diamond version allows for 25 single asset packs to be crafted within a 24 hour window. The Platinum version allows for 10 single asset packs to be crafted a day. To learn more about how the Brawl-o-Seum works and review the level designs that benefit from mutable data, here is a comprehensive [Brawl-o-Seum level design and overview.](https://medium.com/blockchain-brawlers/a-deep-dive-into-brawl-o-seum-leveling-design-740efd3e780a) To understand the user interface flow you can [read this article.](https://medium.com/blockchain-brawlers/blockchain-brawlers-brawl-o-seum-crafting-walkthrough-b0a514046ffb) 

# The PvP Phase
## Beta Testing


There is currently one announced PvP feature in active development at this time. This version of PvP feature utilizes a new card battler mechanic exclusive to Blockchain Brawlers. It was designed and balanced by [Richard Garfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Garfield), the creator of [Magic: The Gathering.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) 

This feature is in varying states of progress and is intended to be live in a full release production environment on October 4th, 2022. 

The intention of the current PvP feature is akin to traditional esports gaming and skill based component. This is not a "Pay to Win" game. The best players will be the ones with the best execution of a strategy relative to the decisions of their opponent. 

At some point near the end of 2022 "League Play" and banding of players tied to [ELO/MMR rankings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) will be in place and drive the activities of global competitions that will be streamed and come replete with top tier prizing.

# Deprecated Items That No Longer Have Utility

## Rings

There are four rings that were used during the "Mining Phase". This is where you would place Brawlers to brawl to possibly earn a [Gold NFT](https://virl.com/collection/asset.a/bcbrawlers) and get some $BRWL. 

Those rings were as follows:

 - [The Backyard (Artifact) Ring](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&data:text.rarity=Artifact&order=asc&schema_name=ring&sort=price&symbol=WAX)
