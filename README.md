# Our Beliefs

We believe that players wants total control over the assets they have acquired. They want to have the right to trade, sell, or giveaway anything they have garnered from within a game be it purchased, crafted, traded for or otherwise obtained.

We believe that players deserve individual sovereignty with regard to the decision on what they can do with digital items in their possession. 

We believe these rights are a fundamental and they are inalienable for all gamers, independent of platform, genre, asset class, or socio-economic status. 

We believe that this level of control and authority will drive the mass adoption of a complimentary Web3 experience that does not only co-exists with standard gaming tenants, but will become table stakes for all games made in the future. This idealology will become the rule and not the exception. 

We believe in building the best games for all players. We lead with objectively excellent entertainment. We aim to always validate a players use of their free time within the worlds we have built. 

We believe in leading by example. We are building a North Star that will show the way, to the benefit of every developer, publisher and gamer in the world. 

We believe all of the ideals fully live and breathe inside Blockchain Brawlers. A truly great game, that just happens to be built on the blockchain. 
    

# Design Principles

Blockchain Brawlers is a platform. It is a multiphase, multifaceted world where players come in and compete, contribute, commune and collaborate. 

Our experiences always are built with the gamer in mind. We start with the player's ambitions and works backwards to a feature or product enhancement that reinforces that belief. By being ultimately user journey focused, a clear and optimized path exists on how to move forward to the benefit of the greater good in the most expeditious way possible. 

There are many challenges in working towards mass market adoption, but in Blockchain Brawlers we do not believe access and usability should be some of those hurdles. 

Blockchain Brawlers players will be able to play and transact on the chain and marketplace of their own choosing. Making our game the most user friendly and navigable game in the world is a stated goal we think we are on the path to do so. 

To reach our player adoption goals, Blockchain Brawlers has to be very familiar to players of traditional games. This is why when you immerse yourself into our "Brawlerverse" it will feel like every non-crypto game you have played before.

Currently available to be played in a browser we will soon add a downloadable Mac and PC client via mass adoption distribution solutions, along with a mobile app availble in the App Store as well as on Google Play coming in 2023.  

# Player vs. Player Asset Requirements

To get started and sign into the game you will need a have a supported wallet. This will be "your account" , where all in game progress and player owned assets are stored. The wallet is the consumer interface into the game. We recommend all players use WAX Cloud Wallet. There are many benefits for WAX Cloud Wallet users, such as account boosting that removes the need for CPU resources per transaciton. To sign up for a WCW, go [here](https://all-access.wax.io/)

In the currenlty available PvP mode, designed by Richard Garfield (creator of Magic: The Gathering) you will take part in an original head to head card game. In order to do this you will need twelve items. You must have a Series 1 Brawler NFT, some playing cards(also NFTs), and the requisite set of moves (also NFTs) of your own choosing. 

Below is an accounting of the minimum items you will need to wage war in the squared circle and where to go and acquire them. 

Must Haves:
(1) NFT Brawler (including but not limited to) - [Mike Yellerbelly](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&data:text.rarity=Artifact&order=asc&schema_name=series1&sort=price&symbol=WAX), [Scotty Wideye](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&data:text.rarity=Common&order=asc&schema_name=series1&sort=price&symbol=WAX), [Barry Greenhorn](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&data:text.rarity=Uncommon&order=asc&schema_name=series1&sort=price&symbol=WAX), [Johnny Butterfinger](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&data:text.rarity=Rare&order=asc&schema_name=series1&sort=price&symbol=WAX), [Colt Tenderfoot](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&data:text.rarity=Epic&order=asc&schema_name=series1&sort=price&symbol=WAX), [Rusty Klutz](https://wax.atomichub.io/market/sale/89934148), [Ric Flair](https://wax.atomichub.io/market/sale/90085842), or any of our [legendary NFT's](https://wax.atomichub.io/market/sale/85365924) that are 1 of 1's. 

(1) Deck of playing cards numbered 1 thru 8. Go [here](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&order=asc&schema_name=cards&sort=price&symbol=WAX) to acquire your eight deck cards

(1) Common Attack move. Go [here](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&data:text.type=Attack&order=desc&schema_nam) to acquire a common Attack. You must always own at least one common attack

(1) Taunt move. Go [here](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&data:text.type=Taunt&order=asc&schema_name=moves&sort=price&symbol=WAX) to acquire a common Taunt

(1) Finisher move. Go [here](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&data:text.type=Finishing%20Move&order=asc&schema_name=moves&sort=price&symbol=WAX) to acquire your common Finisher move 

You can upgrade these moves by acquiring the proper materials for the upgrade recipe. All requirements for upgrading your assets can be found in the game. There are 44 moves in all. There are 19 Attacks, 11 Taunts and 14 Finishing moves ranging from Common through Legendary. Players will always be required to play with this base of 12 items. How you updgrade and increase your arsenal of moves is up to you. The game does allow to set up multiple loadouts for a higher level of collecting and personalization. 

To make getting started easier "Starter Packs" are available to be bought in game, on the vIRL Marketplace and on OpenSean. These bundles all of the above listed required components. To buy them using WAXP go [here](https://play.bcbrawlers.com/marketplace?schemaName=pack&search=Blockchain+Brawlers+Starter+Pack) and to buy them using ETH go [here](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xd1ea531c9bad17909c8ed73ae5bb0265a31113ff/1099832022785/)  

## Where to Take Part in the PvP Phase(s) 

In order to participate in the PvP modes in Blockchain Brawlers just visit the site [play.bcbrawlers.com](https://play.bcbrawlers.com/) and from there the onboarding into the user experience is self-explanatory.  

# The Phases of The Game
## The Mining Phase
The Mining Phase opened on March 30th, 2022 and concluded on August 1st, 2022. This was were players where able to mine the 1 billion fungible [$BRWL tokens](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/brwl-brawlertoken_wax-eosio.token) if they possessed a [Series 1 Brawler NFT](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&order=asc&schema_name=series1&sort=price&symbol=WAX) and a Ring. 

Once the token inventory was exhausted the ability to mine the currency via this farming interactivity concluded. It will not resume ever again. 

## The Crafting Phase: BRAWL-O-SEUM
The Crafting Phase began on September 21st, 2022. If a player is in possession of a [Brawl-o-Seum](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&order=asc&schema_name=land&sort=price&symbol=WAX) NFT they are able to utilize $BRWL tokens to craft every asset required to play every version of PvP that does or will exist in perpetuity. 

The Brawl-o-Seum is effectively a crafting membership key. A limited number of players are in charge of producing content for the masses that want to enter the game. There are only 1,100 "B-o-S" NFT crafting passes in existence. They come in two levels of rarity. The Diamond version allows for 25 single asset packs to be crafted within a 24 hour window. The Platinum version allows for 10 single asset packs to be crafted a day. To learn more about how the Brawl-o-Seum works and review the level designs that benefit from mutable data, here is a comprehensive [Brawl-o-Seum level design and overview.](https://medium.com/blockchain-brawlers/a-deep-dive-into-brawl-o-seum-leveling-design-740efd3e780a) To understand the user interface flow you can [read this article.](https://medium.com/blockchain-brawlers/blockchain-brawlers-brawl-o-seum-crafting-walkthrough-b0a514046ffb)

# The Richard Garfield Designed PvP Phase, now live. 

## How to Play 

The currently available PvP feature in the game is fairly straight forward and deceptively simple. But the simplicity is an illusion as there is a tremendous amount of depth and strategic choices that the players have to make in order to win a round. Like Texas Hold'em poker, the game revolves around the question"are your two cards of a higher value than your opponents two cards"? Whether you decide to state that they are depends on many factors. In all, each round you play involves up to seven strategic decisions. To learn more about the rules of the game, go [here](https://medium.com/blockchain-brawlers/blockchain-brawlers-instruction-manual-e55d8a20d36f))

## Beta Testing

There are currently two announced PvP feature in active development at this time. The first version of PvP feature utilizes a new card battler mechanic exclusive to Blockchain Brawlers. It was designed and balanced by [Richard Garfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Garfield), the creator of [Magic: The Gathering.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) 

This feature is in varying states of progress and the as noted above the WebGL version is available to be played in a testing environment right now. There is no wallet or cost to playing this test version. To access it directly you can go [here](https://play-best.babrawlers.com). The only requirement is you play on your desktop in a Chrome, Safari or Firefox browser. Others browsers may work, but are not officially supported. Mobile web is not currently supported. 

The intention of the current PvP feature is akin to traditional esports gaming and skill based component. This is not a "Pay to Win" game. The best players will be the ones with the best execution of a strategy relative to the decisions of their opponent. 

At some point near the end of 2022 "League Play" and banding of players tied to [MMR rankings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchmaking_(video_games) will be in place and drive the activities of global competitions that will be streamed and come replete with top tier prizing.

To understand all of the assets required to actually compete in the PvP portion of this game be sure to read over the PvP Asset Require section up above

## AI Based Brawler

The additional announced PvP gamemode will be an AI based "King of the Ring" style competition called, "Brawl 4 All". This mode is being developed by Onessus of HodlGod fame and is being developed using the Unreal 5 engine. Forty players will sign up to compete with the brawler of their choice. The game will randomly select the first 8 players to start in the ring and one new Brawler will enter every 15 seconds. If a Brawler takes too much damage they will be unceramoniously tossed out of the ring over the top rope. This will eliminate them from the competition. The last man standing will win. 

Coming in early 2023 - Brawl 4 All! This is a mode that will allow players to enter one of their Brawlers into a Royal Rumble style competition. The match will be 100% AI driven, but the stats per entrant will be an aggregation of all qualifying NFTs the players possess. In all, fourteen different statistical categories will comprise each competitor. This will include obvious traits such as hleath, speed, intelligence. It will also include statistical values such as lady luck, evasion, to hit, crit damage, crit rate, defense, crit damage redux et al. 

In this mode 40 competitors will battle to try and win the King of the Ring competition. Each match will start with 8 Brawlers entering at once and a new competitor streaming in every 15 seconds. Starting and entrance order will be bnased on Luck. If you are the last man standing you win a bevvy of prizes. Players can choose to boost their Brawler heading into the competition, but be careful 33% of the time their will be post match random "boost" testing. If you get caught you are DQ'd. 

Brawl 4 All is currently being developed by developer Onessus, creators of HodlGod and will be out in Q1 2023. 

# Promotional Items That Have Utility 

## FREE TO TRY NFT 

Coming in November of 2022 Tyranno will be widely distrbuting an NFT that will serve as a key for all players wanting to try out Blockchain Brawlers for free for a very limited time. Owners possessing this NFT need only have in their WAX Cloud Wallet and login into the game. When players log into the game and "deposit it" intro their inventory this will burn said NFT. Once this NFT is burned, the player will receive the required 12 starting items needed to try out the game. These twelve items will be a Brawler, an eight card deck, one Attack, Taunt and Finisher move, all common rarity. These will not be NFTs and as such cannot be sold or traded. Nor can these players play and win anything in the head to head matches. Only the "Free to Try" exhibition room will be open to them to play a limit of 5 matches a day. After ten days the promotional assets will expire and be removed automatically from the player's wallet. They will also be watermarked so as to avoid any confusion. 

At any point during the ten day free trial period there will be an incentive available for these players to convert into playing the fully featured PvP game where play and rewards are no longer restricted.  

 ## [Pink Battletags]([https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/template/bcbrawlers/432795](https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/template/bcbrawlers/401084))
 
 Pink Battletags were given away to players for various reasons, mostly to recognize early support of the game. There are 155 in total ciruclation. Every month there is a random give away of the in game fungible token $BRWL to a limited number of players. There is also special whitelist inclusions and certain swag kit give aways these holders are eligible to receive. This program will come to an end December 31st, 2022. 



# Deprecated Items That Have No Utility 
*The below listed items will have no further in game use, as a result their value may be greatly diminished.*

There are four rings that were used during the "Mining Phase". This is where you would place Brawlers to brawl to possibly earn a [Gold NFT](https://virl.com/collection/asset.a/bcbrawlers) and get some $BRWL. 

Those rings were as follows:

 - [The Backyard (Artifact) Ring](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&data:text.rarity=Artifact&order=asc&schema_name=ring&sort=price&symbol=WAX)
