# Our Beliefs

We believe that players wants total control over the assets they have acquired. They want to have the right to trade, sell, or giveaway anything they have garnered from within a game be it purchased, crafted, traded for or otherwise obtained.

We believe that players deserve individual sovereignty with regard to the decision on what they can do with digital items in their possession. 

We believe these rights are a fundamental and they are inalienable for game players in the world, independent of platform, genre, asset class, or socio-economic status. 

We believe that this level of control and authority will drive the mass adoption of a complimentary Web3 experience that does not only co-exists with standard gaming tenants, but will become table stakes for all players in the future.

We believe in building the best games for all gamers. We lead with objectively excellent entertainment. We aim to always validate a players use of their free time within the worlds we have built. 

We believe in leading by example. We are building a North Star that will lead the way to the benefit of every developer, publisher and gamer in the world. 

We believe all of the ideals fully live and breathe inside Blockchain Brawlers. A truly great game, that just happens to be built on the blockchain 
    

# Design Principles

Blockchain Brawlers is a platform. It is a multiphase, multifaceted world where players come in and compete, contribute, commune and collaborate. 

Our experiences always are built with the gamer in mind. We start with the player concerns and works backwards to a feature or product enhancement that resolves that point of tension or friction. By being so user journey focused, a clear and optimized path exists on how to move forward to the benefit of the greater good in the most expeditious way possible. 

There are many challenges in working towards mass market adoption, but in Blockchain Brawlers we do not believe access and usability should be some of those hurdles. 

Blockchain Brawler players will be able to play and transact on the chain and marketplace of choice. Making our game the most user friendly and navigable game in the world is a stated goal we think we are on the path to accomplish. 

To reach our player adoption goals, Blockchain Brawlers has to be very familiar to players of traditional games. This is why when you immerse yourself into our "Brawlerverse" it will feel like every non-crypto game you have played before.

Currently available to be played in a browser we will soon add a download Mac and PC client via the Epic Store, along with mobile apps to be found in the App Store as well as on Google Play coming in late 2022. 

# Player vs. Player Asset Requirements

In the PvP mode coming out at the end of October you will take part in an original head to head card game. In order to do this you will need to have a Series 1 Brawler NFT, some playing cards(also NFTs), and the requisite set of moves (also NFTs) of your own choosing. 

Below is an accounting of the minimum items you will need to wage war in the squared circle and where to go and acquire them. 

Must Haves:

## Where to Take Part in the PvP Phase when it launches

In order to participate in the PvP modes in Blockchain Brawlers just visit the site [play.bcbrawlers.com](https://play.bcbrawlers.com/) and from there the onboarding into the user experience is self-explanatory.  

# The Phases of The Game
## The Mining Phase
The Mining Phase opened on March 30th, 2022 and concluded on August 1st, 2022. This was were players where able to mine the 1 billion fungible [$BRWL tokens](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/brwl-brawlertoken_wax-eosio.token) if they possessed a [Series 1 Brawler NFT](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&order=asc&schema_name=series1&sort=price&symbol=WAX) and a Ring. 

Once the token inventory was exhausted the ability to mine the currency via this farming interactivity concluded. It will not resume ever again. 

## The Crafting Phase: BRAWL-O-SEUM
The Crafting Phase began on September 21st, 2022. If a player is in possession of a [Brawl-o-Seum](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&order=asc&schema_name=land&sort=price&symbol=WAX) NFT they are able to utilize $BRWL tokens to craft every asset required to play every version of PvP that does or will exist in perpetuity. 

The Brawl-o-Seum is effectively a crafting membership key. These limited number of players will be in charge of producing content for the masses that want to enter the game. There are only 1,100 "B-o-S" NFT crafting passes in existence. They come in two levels of rarity. The Diamond version allows for 25 single asset packs to be crafted within a 24 hour window. The Platinum version allows for 10 single asset packs to be crafted a day. To learn more about how the Brawl-o-Seum works and review the level designs that benefit from mutable data, here is a comprehensive [Brawl-o-Seum level design and overview.](https://medium.com/blockchain-brawlers/a-deep-dive-into-brawl-o-seum-leveling-design-740efd3e780a) To understand the user interface flow you can [read this article.](https://medium.com/blockchain-brawlers/blockchain-brawlers-brawl-o-seum-crafting-walkthrough-b0a514046ffb) 

# The PvP Phase
## Beta Testing

There are currently two announced PvP feature in active development at this time. The first version of PvP feature utilizes a new card battler mechanic exclusive to Blockchain Brawlers. It was designed and balanced by [Richard Garfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Garfield), the creator of [Magic: The Gathering.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) 

This feature is in varying states of progress and the as noted above the WebGL version is available to be played right now. There is no wallet or cost to playing this test version. To access it directly you can go [here](https://play-best.babrawlers.com). The only requirement is you play on your desktop in a Chrome, Safari or Firefox browser. Others browsers may work, but are not officially supported. Mobile web is not currently supported. 

The intention of the current PvP feature is akin to traditional esports gaming and skill based component. This is not a "Pay to Win" game. The best players will be the ones with the best execution of a strategy relative to the decisions of their opponent. 

At some point near the end of 2022 "League Play" and banding of players tied to [ELO/MMR rankings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) will be in place and drive the activities of global competitions that will be streamed and come replete with top tier prizing.

For a video tutorial of how to play [go here](https://medium.com/blockchain-brawlers/blockchain-brawlers-summer-block-party-week-2-brings-the-heat-with-pvp-gameplay-first-look-d9f714b2237f). 

To understand all of the assets required to actually compete in the PvP portion of this game be sure to read over the PvP Asset Require section down below. 

## AI Based Brawler

The additional announced PvP gamemode will be an AI based "King of the Ring" style competition called, "Brawl 4 All". This mode is being developed by Onessus of HodlGod fame and is being developed using the Unreal 5 engine. Forty players will sign up to compete with the brawler of their choice. The game will randomly select the first 8 players to start in the ring and one new Brawler will enter every 15 seconds. If a Brawler takes too much damage they will be unceramoniously tossed out of the ring over the top rope. This will eliminate them from the competition. The last man standing will win. 

This mode is in active development and should be live before the end of the year. 

# Promotional Items That Have Utility 

_FREE TO TRY NFT_ is a distributed NFT for all players wanting to try out Blockchain Brawlers for free for a very limited time. Owners possessing this NFT need only deposit it into their WAX Cloud Wallet. It will be burned upon deposit. Once deposited they will receive the required 12 starting items needed to try out the game. These twelve items will be a Brawler, an eight card deck, one Attack, Taunt and Finisher move, all common. These will not be NFTs and as such cannot be sold or traded. Nor can these players play and win anything in the head to head matches. Only the "Free to Try" exhibition room will be open to them to play a limit of 5 matches a day. After ten days the promotional assets will expire and be removed automatically from the player's wallet. They will also be watermarked so as to avoid any confusion. 

At any point during the ten day free trial period there will be an incentive available for these players to convert into playing the fully featured PvP game where play and rewards are no longer restricted.  

 ## [Pink Battletags]([https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/template/bcbrawlers/432795](https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/template/bcbrawlers/401084))
 
 Pink Battletags were given away to players for various reasons, mostly to recognize early support of the game. There are 155 in total ciruclation. Every month there is a random give away of the in game fungible token $BRWL to a limited number of players. There is also special whitelist inclusions and certain swag kit give aways these holders are eligible to receive. This program will come to an end December 31st, 2022. 



# Deprecated Items That Have No Utility 
*The below listed items will have no further in game use, as a result their value may be greatly diminished.*

## Rings

There are four rings that were used during the "Mining Phase". This is where you would place Brawlers to brawl to possibly earn a [Gold NFT](https://virl.com/collection/asset.a/bcbrawlers) and get some $BRWL. 

Those rings were as follows:

 - [The Backyard (Artifact) Ring](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=bcbrawlers&data:text.rarity=Artifact&order=asc&schema_name=ring&sort=price&symbol=WAX)
